== Changelog ==

= 1.2.1 (2026-09-01) =
* Fixed Block Checkout: selecting "Απόδειξη" (Receipt) still required Company Name, ΑΦΜ, ΔΟΥ, and Business Activity even though those fields are correctly hidden — the customer could not complete the order
* Hardened the required-fields feature to only apply on WooCommerce 9.9.0+ (needed for per-field conditional requirements); older WooCommerce versions fall back to server-side-only enforcement instead of the client incorrectly treating fields as always required

= 1.2.0 (2026-08-11) =
* Added per-field required/optional settings for invoice fields (Company Name, ΑΦΜ, ΔΟΥ, Business Activity) — all 4 required by default
* Fixed Block Checkout showing Company Name, ΔΟΥ, and Business Activity as "(Optional)" while the server actually required them
* Fixed the uppercase-conversion setting not being saved under the option it was read from
* Updated donate link

= 1.1.0 (2026-03-13) =
* Added WooCommerce Block Checkout support via Additional Checkout Fields API
* Added checkout type setting (Classic / Block) in admin
* Added block checkout position setting (Contact / Order section)
* Added conditional field visibility in block checkout (show/hide based on invoice type)
* Added company name field for block checkout
* Made VAT number (ΑΦΜ) mandatory
* Block checkout fields display natively in admin orders and emails
* Improved code quality and validation

= 1.0.8 (2025-01-17) =
* Simplified plugin for WordPress.org release
* Added real-time VAT validation (9 digits)
* Added numeric-only input filter for VAT field
* Beautified admin settings page with gradient styling
* Added author information and donate button
* Improved checkout JavaScript for better field toggle
* Enhanced mobile responsiveness
* Removed advanced features temporarily (moved to roadmap)
* Updated documentation

= 1.0.7 =
* Fixed checkout field toggle functionality
* Improved CSS styling
* Bug fixes and performance improvements

= 1.0.0 =

* Greek VAT fields (ΑΦΜ, ΔΟΥ)
* Company information fields

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.2.1 =
Fixes a bug where Block Checkout customers selecting "Απόδειξη" (Receipt) could not complete their order — the hidden invoice fields were still being treated as required. Update recommended if you use Block Checkout.

= 1.2.0 =
New: choose which invoice fields (Company, ΑΦΜ, ΔΟΥ, Business Activity) are required vs optional, per field. All 4 remain required by default, so behavior is unchanged unless you opt in. Also fixes the uppercase-conversion setting and updates the donate link. If you previously unchecked the uppercase-conversion setting, please re-check its state after updating — the fix for the setting id means it will show enabled again.

= 1.1.0 =
New: WooCommerce Block Checkout support! Choose between Classic and Block checkout in settings. VAT number is now mandatory for invoices.

= 1.0.8 =
Simplified version with improved validation and beautiful admin interface. Advanced features (AADE, VIES, PDFs) coming in future updates.
